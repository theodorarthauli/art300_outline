    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        According to Piaget's theory on children's development, intelectual is something that can be developed, and the process involves biological 
        maturation and interaction within the environment (Piaget, 1936, as cited in McLeod, 2018). The process of learning can be done in many ways. As for children, especially at 
        the stages of pre-kindergarten and elementary school aged, play is important and becomes part of their learning process (White, n.d.). Based on the United Nations High
        Commissions for Human Rights, every child has the right to play (Ginsburg, 2007). The idea of learning through playing is also supported by Piaget’s theory that saying, 
        creating a playful learning setting for children is important in order to enhance their success in academy, attitude, and creativity (Feitelson & Ross, 1973; Lieberman, 1965, 
        1966; Meador,1992; Meichenbaum,1971; Pepler, 1986; Schafer,1969; Spivak & Levine,1964; Sutton-Smith & Sutton-Smith,1974, as cited in Boyer, 1997). Play does not only benefit 
        benefit the children, but also the parents or caregiver because it gives them the opportunity to understand the children from their perspective. Therefore, it gives the opportunity 
        to build a successful communication between children and parents or caregiver (Ginsburg, 2007). In this paper the focus is not only about the importance of play, but also about 
        how the environment supports the children’s learning. Letting the children to play in a supportive environment that allows them to explore through their sensory senses will help with 
        the brain development (Good Start, 2016). And children’s museum is one of the places that allows the children to freely explore their surrounding where they are not told what to do or how 
        to do it.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Nowadays, people spend most of the time indoor, regardless the age, especially for children at the age of pre-K and elementary school. They would stay and spend time with technology. Allowing 
        children to be active is one of the key elements to help them to develop and maintain their physical health and emotional health (CDC, 2015, as cited in Williams, 2017). 
    </p>

    <p>
        A newborn baby is born with about 100 billion brain cells or neurons and this number is more than the amount that adults have (Rettig, 1999). Just like a plant, if it is not taken care of it 
        would die, but if it is nurtured, it would grow and expand in number. So does the brain, when it is not used the number of neurons would be decreased or even die, this is also known as neural 
        pruning. Whereas, when the brain is in use, it can create a strong synaptic connection, known as neural branching (Crdellichio & Field, 1997, as cited in Rettig, 1999). 
    </p>

    <p>
        Preschool-aged is the time where children start to learn and try to make senses of their surrounding through their sensory senses. By doing that active exploration, it helps the children to gain 
        new knowledge and try to understand an abstract idea that is unfamiliar to them. Especially from the age of three to five where the children start to explore their surrounding through their senses. 
        So, it is important for children to learn a new knowledge by doing active activity (Valett, 1983; Piaget and Inhelder, 1971; O’Neill, Astington, and Flavell, 1992, as cited in Boyer, 1997).
    </p>
    
    <h2>Children development and learning</h2>
    <p>
        Jean Piaget is a Swiss psychologist who is known for his work on children’s development. He explains that cognitive development is the period when children formulate the surrounding around them. 
        He believes that intellectual is something that can be developed. Thus, he explains that “cognitive development as a process which occurs due to biological maturation and interaction with the environment” 
        (Piaget, 1936, as cited in McLeod, 2018, Jean Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development, para. 1). 
    </p>

    <p>
        In the early era of psychology of children, psychologists created a hypothesis that the way children think is not as capable as adults do (McLeod, 2018). However, through research of cognitive development 
        that Piaget did, he showed that the way children think is noticeably different than adults. He explains that, “children are born with a very basic mental structure (generally inherited and evolved) on which 
        all subsequent learning and knowledge are based” (McLeod, 2018, Jean Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development, para. 6).
    </p>

    <h2>Play and being active</h2>
    <p>
        Learning new knowledge can be done in many different types of activity. As for children, play is part of a learning process, active learning process (White, n.d) and based on the United Nations High Commissions 
        for Human Rights every child has the right to play because it is important for their developmental process (Ginsburg, 2007). Play itself does not have a specific definition, however there are many theories that 
        describe what play is. According to the founder of the National Institute for Play, Stuart Brown, play is “anything that spontaneously is done for its own sake. … it appears purposeless, produces pleasure and joy, 
        [and] leads to the next stage of mastery” (Tippet, 2008 as cited in White, n.d., p. 6). Adding on that, “play includes activities that are freely chosen and directed by children and arise from intrinsic motivation” 
        (Miller and Almon, 2009, as cited in White, n.d., p. 6). There are two components of play, which are active (such as rolling and jumping) and inactive (such as resting and being lazy) (Senda, 1992, as cited in Khalili, 2010, p. 9).
    </p>

    <p>
        Based on Todd Dawson, Good start WA state manager, from the early age children already start to develop their self-esteem and by playing it allows them to become active learners (Good Start, n.d.). Moreover, playing and being active 
        in learning process help their brains to develop emotional, social, and physical aspects and not only that some skills are also developed such as creativity, communication, problem solving, resilience, and emotional regulation and 
        relationship (Children’s Museum of South Dakota, n.d.; White, n.d.; Good Start, n.d.; Ginsburg, 2007). Not only beneficial to the children, play also gives an opportunity to the parents to understand their children from their 
        perspective. Thus, being able to understand their children, it allows the parents to have a successful communication while guiding their children (Ginsburg, 2007). In the figure 2, shows the benefits of play in more depth that 
        support children in their “cognitive growth, improved social skills, physical development and emotional well- being” (Davis, Graves and Larkin, 2002, p. 42, as Cited in Khalili, 2010, p. 10). 
    </p>

    <h2>Children and museum</h2>
    <p>
        Museum is known to be a place where people can enjoy display arts, but now only for that but also it is a space for gaining knowledge “in addition to the spaces that house and interpret museum collections, museums increasingly 
        invest in specialized spaces for education” (Gul and Akmehmet, 2016, p. 141). Nowadays, museum has changed its marketing target of visitors to children, even though there have not been many researches on how children interact 
        inside a museum (Debenedetti, Caro, and Krebs, 2009). Not only changing their target on visitors, some museums have changed its focus on how visitors experience the space, being involve with the arts (Schubert, 2004, as cited 
        in Gul and Akmehmet, 2016). Based on research that is conducted on the visitors, interactive installation is needed to allow them not only to engage with the arts but also gain something new from it (Greenhill, 1992; Schubert, 
        2004, as cited in Gul and Akmehmet, 2016). 
    </p>

    <p>
        In the perspective of children, museum is a place that provide different settings than the places they are familiar with, such as houses and schools. The differences are related to “scale of the buildings, atmospheres, 
        collections, objects, use and unwritten rules of engagement” (Hackett, Holmes, MacRae, and Procter, 2018, p. 482). Going back to focus on visitors’ experience in the museum, interactive activities are needed to allow interaction. 
        The word ‘interaction’ has various depending on the fields and controversial. The basic definition is the idea of communication (Jackel, 1995; Jensen, 1998, as cited in Gul & Akmehmet, 2016, p. 142). As for children, 
        “multisensory experiences” are the type of interactive activities that are meaningful for them (Weter and Piscitelli, 2003, as cited in Birch, 2018, p. 519) and that is their way of learning (Piscitelli and Penfold, 2015, as cited 
        in Birch, 2018). 
    </p>

    <h2>Children and environment</h2>
    <p>
        The process of children’s development is a collaboration among teacher, the quality of educational program and the physical environment, known as “third educator” (Hebert, 1998; Moore & Sugiyama, 2007; Weinstein, 1987 as cited in 
        Berris & Miller, 2011). There has been some studies that show a connection between children’s development and their environment both interior (room size, layout, furniture, lighting, noise) and exterior (outdoor space, nature, 
        play equipment) (Evans, 2006 as cited in Berris & Miller, 2011).
    </p>

    <h3>Function in a space</h3>
    <p>
        As an architect there are some factors that need to be considered when designing an architectural building, which are form, shape, and function. However, when it comes to designing for children-space, there is another factor 
        that needs to be considered, which is the function of the space. Children view a space more to its function rather than the aesthetic of it (Matthews, 1992; Christensen, 2003, as cited in Said, n.d.). An example to this is, a 
        pediatric. For architect, pediatric is like hospital for children, so to differentiate it a playroom space is designed for children to allow them to play with toys or television to watch. Even though the purpose of the space 
        is to make them to feel relaxed, but it turns out the children feel bored and stress (Lau, 2002, as cited in Said, n.d.) because of some factors (i) the children is not familiar with the space, (ii) the children do not have 
        control or limited options to manipulate the objects in the space (Said, 2006, as cited in Said, n.d.).
    </p>

    <p>
        When architects design a building, it means that is final, which does not allow children to transform it. From the cognitive development theory, it is understood that when children do not have control to modify something as 
        their wish, then they will not grow their feeling towards it. Thus, the space fails to let the children to develop their ability to explore with their own preference (Said, n.d). Having an attachment feeling to a space would 
        not only give a positive psychological feeling to the children, but also helps them to develop their awareness towards self-confidence and self-worth (Stankovic, 2008). Stankovic (2008) also added by saying, “… architectural 
        space with what constitutes it and what is set inside of it an makes it an architectural unit, becomes an instrument that fulfills biological, social and cultural needs of the person using it” (p. 230).
    </p>

    <h3>Space</h3>
    <p>
        When designing a space for children it is normal to use the term ‘child-friendly’ which “… over-simplifies and packages up adults and children separately ‘as something totally quantified, measured and defined to the last 
        detail […]’” (Bakhtin, 1984, p. 58, cited in Frank, 2005, p. 965, as cited in Birch, 2018, p. 520). This term is related to what a designer could do and could not do when designing a space for children, especially in 
        museum setting (Bone and Blaise, 2015, as cited in Birch, 2018). It turns out that children like a space that is not intentionally designed for them (Whitzman and Mizrachi, 2012, as cited in Birch, 2018). However, as 
        for security for them, it is still important to design a space that is appropriate in scale because it can also boost their confidence (Weinstein, 1987, as cited in Read, 1996), also it is required that each children 
        need a space of 3m2 of the floor area (Ata et al., 2012, p. 2035).
    </p>

    <p>
        Since, children, in their perspective, could not control what has been designed by architect, there is the interior element of the building that can be designed so that children can feel free to explore. Olds is one 
        of the researches that does research on children’s environment, she states that, “to design for aesthetic richness, the building’s or room’s elements (floors, walls, ceilings, horizontal and vertical supports, 
        objects, forms, and architectural details) all should be conceived of as interactive surfaces” (Olds, 1989, as cited in Read, 1996, p. 15). Moreover, the space should be “flexible, with moveable furnishings and 
        equipment, offering play places at different angles and levels” (Curtis & Carter, 2005, as cited in Berris & Miller, 2011, p. 3). Another thing that needs to be considered is creating spaces for active activity 
        and quite activity (Ata et al., 2012). With regard to this, ceiling height can help to determine the use of the space, a space that has low ceiling is considered for quite activity purposes, while ceiling height 
        that is more than 8’0” is considered for active purposes (Moore and other, 1979, as cited in Read, 1996). 
    </p>

    <h3>Color and light</h3>
    <p>
        For children color can affect their actions at a specific setting (Khalili, 2010) and texture of material is connected to their cognitive development (Ata et al., 2012). There is a study that study color and children 
        saying, “children love colour and respond to it well but that does not mean the only approach is to use primaries” (Marberry and Zagon, 1995, p. 32, as cited in (Khalili, 2010, p. 16). Another study saying that, 
        “appropriate colours are important in protecting eyesight, creating surroundings that are contributive to study and in promoting physical and mental health” (Mahnke, 1996, as cited in Khalili, 2010, p. 17).
    </p>

    <p>
        Colors to children is related to emotion, bright colors (such as pink, blue, red) can give a positive emotion, whereas dark colors (such as brown, black, gray) can give a negative emotion (Ata et al., 2012, p. 2037). 
        Not only related to emotion, color can have affect children’s behavior. The use of cool colors can give a relaxing effect and is recommended to be used in inactive area, while warm colors can evoke a pleasant and 
        happy feeling and is recommended to be applied in active area; as for accent color, the use of bright color is commonly use (Ata et al., 2012, p. 2037; Olds, 1989, as cited in Read, 1996, p. 21, 25).
    </p>

    <h3>Safety and material</h3>
    <p>
        U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is one of the government websites that provides guidelines for children-centered spaces. In the chapter 9: Interior Finishes is a chapter that talks about how finishes 
        in the space should be. Based on the general requirement of the finishes there are factors that need to be considered when choosing the materials, which are “durability, maintenance requirements, life cycle costs, 
        appropriateness and aesthetics” (GSA, 2003, p. 9-1). Moreover, the finishes that is used in the space should give a “home-like” feeling that also incorporates the natural materials (GSA, 2003).
    </p>

    <p>
        In the section of 9.2 Color and Texture, it states that for the use of color it is recommended that primary color is not used on walls. Moreover, since children clothes normally would be colorful, it is better to 
        us a few color palettes on their surroundings. As for the texture in the space, the use of “hard texture” material is suitable in the space that is dominated by for active activity. Also, adding a touch of 
        natural textures is suggested since children finds it fascinating (GSA, 2003, p. 9-2).
    </p>

    <h2>Proposed Method</h2>
    <p>
        In the perspective of children, museum is a place that is filled with fascinating things that they can freely explore. For adults with children visit the museum might think that they need to help them understand
        what is going on (Piscitelli et al., 2003). When in fact, children are “natural philosophers who, when given time, encouragement and support, are very capable of making meaning from their encounters with the
        world” (Lipman, Sharp, & Oscanyan, 1980, as cited in Piscitelli et al., 2003, p. 22).
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        It is still common for people to understand that learning is the factor that support development, while in fact based on Piaget’s theory, it is development that defines how learning for each person is different 
        (Piaget, 1964). As the children learn, there is a continuous process that happens in order for children gaining new knowledge. This process involves assimilation and accommodation that is supported by equilibrium 
        that works as a bridge to connect an existing schema to a situation or as an aid that help to solve a problem when challenge occur. 
    </p>

    <p>
        As time changes, so does competition in every field happen. Parents, nowadays, try to make their children focus on their academic because they want to prepare their children to face the future at early age. 
        However, as an active learner child needs to be able to play and being active while learning new knowledge through their sensory senses because that is how they learn. People might not see the benefit of 
        play that is why play time for children is decreasing. In fact, play time gives benefits to the children in terms of cognitive, social, physical, and emotional.
