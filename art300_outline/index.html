    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        According to Piaget's theory on children's development, intelectual is something that can be developed, and the process involves biological 
        maturation and interaction within the environment (Piaget, 1936, as cited in McLeod, 2018). The process of learning can be done in many ways. As for children, especially at 
        the stages of pre-kindergarten and elementary school aged, play is important and becomes part of their learning process (White, n.d.). Based on the United Nations High
        Commissions for Human Rights, every child has the right to play (Ginsburg, 2007). The idea of learning through playing is also supported by Piaget’s theory that saying, 
        creating a playful learning setting for children is important in order to enhance their success in academy, attitude, and creativity (Feitelson & Ross, 1973; Lieberman, 1965, 
        1966; Meador,1992; Meichenbaum,1971; Pepler, 1986; Schafer,1969; Spivak & Levine,1964; Sutton-Smith & Sutton-Smith,1974, as cited in Boyer, 1997). Play does not only benefit 
        benefit the children, but also the parents or caregiver because it gives them the opportunity to understand the children from their perspective. Therefore, it gives the opportunity 
        to build a successful communication between children and parents or caregiver (Ginsburg, 2007). In this paper the focus is not only about the importance of play, but also about 
        how the environment supports the children’s learning. Letting the children to play in a supportive environment that allows them to explore through their sensory senses will help with 
        the brain development (Good Start, 2016). And children’s museum is one of the places that allows the children to freely explore their surrounding where they are not told what to do or how 
        to do it.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Nowadays, people spend most of the time indoor, regardless the age, especially for children at the age of pre-K and elementary school. They would stay and spend time with technology. Allowing 
        children to be active is one of the key elements to help them to develop and maintain their physical health and emotional health (CDC, 2015, as cited in Williams, 2017).

        A newborn baby is born with about 100 billion brain cells or neurons and this number is more than the amount that adults have (Rettig, 1999). Just like a plant, if it is not taken care of it 
        would die, but if it is nurtured, it would grow and expand in number. So does the brain, when it is not used the number of neurons would be decreased or even die, this is also known as neural 
        pruning. Whereas, when the brain is in use, it can create a strong synaptic connection, known as neural branching (Crdellichio & Field, 1997, as cited in Rettig, 1999). 
    </p>

        Preschool-aged is the time where children start to learn and try to make senses of their surrounding through their sensory senses. By doing that active exploration, it helps the children to gain 
        new knowledge and try to understand an abstract idea that is unfamiliar to them. Especially from the age of three to five where the children start to explore their surrounding through their senses. 
        So, it is important for children to learn a new knowledge by doing active activity (Valett, 1983; Piaget and Inhelder, 1971; O’Neill, Astington, and Flavell, 1992, as cited in Boyer, 1997).

    <h2>Children development and learning</h2>
    <p>
        Jean Piaget is a Swiss psychologist who is known for his work on children’s development. He explains that cognitive development is the period when children formulate the surrounding around them. 
        He believes that intellectual is something that can be developed. Thus, he explains that “cognitive development as a process which occurs due to biological maturation and interaction with the environment” 
        (Piaget, 1936, as cited in McLeod, 2018, Jean Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development, para. 1). 
    </p>

    <p>
        In the early era of psychology of children, psychologists created a hypothesis that the way children think is not as capable as adults do (McLeod, 2018). However, through research of cognitive development 
        that Piaget did, he showed that the way children think is noticeably different than adults. He explains that, “children are born with a very basic mental structure (generally inherited and evolved) on which 
        all subsequent learning and knowledge are based” (McLeod, 2018, Jean Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development, para. 6).
    </p>

    <h2>Play and being active</h2>
    <p>
        Learning new knowledge can be done in many different types of activity. As for children, play is part of a learning process, active learning process (White, n.d) and based on the United Nations High Commissions 
        for Human Rights every child has the right to play because it is important for their developmental process (Ginsburg, 2007). Play itself does not have a specific definition, however there are many theories that 
        describe what play is. According to the founder of the National Institute for Play, Stuart Brown, play is “anything that spontaneously is done for its own sake. … it appears purposeless, produces pleasure and joy, 
        [and] leads to the next stage of mastery” (Tippet, 2008 as cited in White, n.d., p. 6). Adding on that, “play includes activities that are freely chosen and directed by children and arise from intrinsic motivation” 
        (Miller and Almon, 2009, as cited in White, n.d., p. 6). There are two components of play, which are active (such as rolling and jumping) and inactive (such as resting and being lazy) (Senda, 1992, as cited in Khalili, 2010, p. 9).
    </p>

    <p>
        Based on Todd Dawson, Good start WA state manager, from the early age children already start to develop their self-esteem and by playing it allows them to become active learners (Good Start, n.d.). Moreover, playing and being active 
        in learning process help their brains to develop emotional, social, and physical aspects and not only that some skills are also developed such as creativity, communication, problem solving, resilience, and emotional regulation and 
        relationship (Children’s Museum of South Dakota, n.d.; White, n.d.; Good Start, n.d.; Ginsburg, 2007). Not only beneficial to the children, play also gives an opportunity to the parents to understand their children from their 
        perspective. Thus, being able to understand their children, it allows the parents to have a successful communication while guiding their children (Ginsburg, 2007). In the figure 2, shows the benefits of play in more depth that 
        support children in their “cognitive growth, improved social skills, physical development and emotional well- being” (Davis, Graves and Larkin, 2002, p. 42, as Cited in Khalili, 2010, p. 10).

    <h2>Children and museum</h2>
    <p>
        Museum is known to be a place where people can enjoy display arts, but now only for that but also it is a space for gaining knowledge “in addition to the spaces that house and interpret museum collections, museums increasingly 
        invest in specialized spaces for education” (Gul and Akmehmet, 2016, p. 141). Nowadays, museum has changed its marketing target of visitors to children, even though there have not been many researches on how children interact 
        inside a museum (Debenedetti, Caro, and Krebs, 2009). Not only changing their target on visitors, some museums have changed its focus on how visitors experience the space, being involve with the arts (Schubert, 2004, as cited 
        in Gul and Akmehmet, 2016). Based on research that is conducted on the visitors, interactive installation is needed to allow them not only to engage with the arts but also gain something new from it (Greenhill, 1992; Schubert, 
        2004, as cited in Gul and Akmehmet, 2016).
